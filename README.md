# Sal-Shipping

Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers.\
In this project, I will build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package.

There are three types of shipping options. They are ground shipping, premium ground shipping and drone shipping.

Step 1: Create a function for the cost of ground shipping.\
Step 2: Create a variable for the cost of premium ground shipping.\
Step 3: Create a function for the cost of drone shipping.\
Step 4: Combine the above functions.
